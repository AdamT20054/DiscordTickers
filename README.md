## Disclaimer:
These bots are free to use in your Discord server! Keep your server up to date with the latest cryptocurrency prices and other relevant data!


## Built With

Built with Discord.js V13, soon to be migrated over to Discord.py

## Getting Started

To invite a bot to your server, simply find the currencies you want and click the invite link. The bot should then join your server!

### Colour changing roles and nicknames

To enable nickname prices, you will need to make sure the bot can manage it's nickname.

To enable color changing you will need to create three roles.

The first role is the role the tickers will appear under. It can be named anything you want. You need to check the Display role members seperatly from other online members option for this role, but do not assign a custom color for this role, leave it default.

Then you need to make two other roles. These roles need to be named exactly tickers-red & tickers-green. Do not check the Display role members seperatly from other online members option for these roles, but do assign colors to these roles, red and green (or whatever color you want to represent gain/loss) respectively.

The last two roles tickers-green and tickers-red need to be below the first role in the role list in your server settings. You should then add all your ticker bots to the first role.

Colour changing roles are a donator feature, they are a free feature for any bots in less than 4500 servers (after 4500 servers rate limit issues become a problem so we have to prioritise certain features).

## Common issues

### Why cant I invite the bot to my server? It is saying about "verification"

If you get a verification error when inviting the bot, it means it is waiting for Discord to verify it (A process required when the bot reaches 100 servers). We have no ETA for verification, so try again at a later date. You can join the support server to be notified when the bot passes verification (https://discord.gg/YbtckEktmn)
